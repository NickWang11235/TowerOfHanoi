Algorithm in plain English

Base Case - When n = 1
  Move the disc from start pole to end pole

Recursive Case - When n > 1
  Step 1: Move (n-1) discs from start pole to auxiliary pole.
  Step 2: Move the last disc from start pole to end pole.
  Step 3: Move the (n-1) discs from auxiliary pole to end pole.
  Steps 1 and 3 are recursive invocations of the same procedure.
