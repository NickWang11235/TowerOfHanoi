Proposed solution: 
   
    1. The recursive call of the base case will occur more and more frequently in higher disc counts. 
    After analyzing the solution through hand tracing, it seems that the frequency of the call of base case increase 
    exponentially according to function 2^x. This suggests that the method must recursivelly call upon itself twice 
    in each iteration of the method. 
    
    2. The destination of the moving of the disc changes, this leads me to suggest that the 3 stacks start, mid and end
    may be stored in an arraylist to be cycled through using a "circular" linkedlist to change the destination of the next
    move.

    3. A counter object may be needed to be used as the ending condition of the recursion calls.
